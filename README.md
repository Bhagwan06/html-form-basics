## Styling

Custom styles are applied using an external CSS file (`index.css`) and embedded CSS. Key styling features include:

  - Red color for `Phone Number`, `Email`, and `Password` labels.
  
- **Pseudo-element Styling**: 
  - The first letter of the `#element` paragraph is styled in a custom color (rgb(241, 13, 51)).
  
- **Link Styling**:
  - The `Dented code` link (`#pseudo`) is styled with:
    - Green color
    - 24px font size
    - Bolder font-weight
  - **Hover effect**: Changes the link color to purple on hover.
  
- **Embedded CSS**: 
  - Red color is applied to the `<h1>` heading.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the HTML and CSS code into `.html` and `.css` files respectively.
2. Ensure that the external CSS file is linked correctly within the HTML file.
3. Open the `.html` file in any modern web browser.
4. Interact with the form elements and observe the custom styling.
